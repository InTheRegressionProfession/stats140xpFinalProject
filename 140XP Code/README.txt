songs.csv is the raw data from Kaggle
songsv2.csv is the raw data but with genre split into boolean columns, one for each genre
genre_new.txt is a replacement for the genre column in the raw data to create a third variation

Our code is split by focus rather than section, so a “Hypothesis” file will cover both the EDA and the Analysis figures and findings for that hypothesis.
